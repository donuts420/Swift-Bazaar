# **The Problem**
The transaction process in India of buying digital arts is very crucial and time-consuming. Even though payment through cryptocurrency is legal, the method is inefficient, making it a non-preferred option for many, especially for people who aren't familiar with crypto banking methods. Additionally, due to the lack of awareness and understanding of cryptocurrency, many people in India are unable to access certain websites that exclusively accept cryptocurrency as payment. These platforms often cater to niche markets where privacy, decentralization, or global accessibility is prioritized.
